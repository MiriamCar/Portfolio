# Data Analyst Portfolio
**Hi there!**:wave:

**Iâ€™m Miriam and this repository is my portfolio of data analytics projects. In this repo I will be shearing projects that I have completed for self-learning as well as hobby purposes.**

## Language and Tools
**R | PYTHON | SQL | PostgreSQL | Microsoft SQL Server | Power BI**

## Data analysis projects with R

[**Risk factors for cardiovascular heart disease**](https://github.com/MiriamCar/Portfolio/tree/main/Data%20analysis%20projects%20with%20R/Risk%20factors%20for%20cardiovascular%20heart%20disease)

The overall goal is to predict the occurrence of cardiovascular disease conditions and to identify the most important risk factors. For this purpose, different classification ML algorithms were considered (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest and k-nearest neighbor).  This project is presented in the form of jupyter notebook but you can also read it in the Rmarkdown HTLM version published in [Rpubs](https://rpubs.com/miriamc/1014551).

Contents:

[**Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques for market segmentation (PCA + K-means)**]

The aim of this project is to obtain the segmentation of products based on the revenue generated in different regions of India in order to understand the market trends.This project is presented in the form of R Markdown but you can also read it in the HTLM version published in [Rpubs](https://rpubs.com/miriamc/1019241).

Contents:
+ Exploratory Data Analysis
+ Data preprocessing
+ Asessing clustering tendency
